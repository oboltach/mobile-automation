Recommended order (impact → effort)

CI/CD first (GitHub Actions or Jenkins) + rock-solid artifacts & reporting
Make your suite runnable on every PR and visible to everyone. This multiplies the value of your current work and forces discipline around flakiness.

Do now

Add a CI job that runs headless simulators with a small smoke tag on PRs, full suite nightly.

Publish Allure results, attach videos/logs/screenshots as artifacts.

Enforce status checks (fail the PR when smoke breaks).

Add a flaky-test quarantine label and report (Allure categories).

Acceptance criteria

npm run test:smoke green on PRs; artifacts visible from CI UI.

One-click link from PR → Allure trend.

Median run time under 10–12 minutes for PR smoke.

Android parity (hybrid platform)
Once CI is humming, add Android so you can catch platform drift early.

Do now

Create shared “screen” objects with platform selectors (iOS/Android locators side-by-side).

Stand up 1–2 AVDs (e.g., Pixel 7/Android 14 & 15) and wire into the CI matrix.

Acceptance criteria

Same tests run with --platform=ios|android via config matrix.

Platform-specific capabilities + selectors live in one place.

Stability & speed hardening

Replace sleeps with explicit waits; add network idling helpers.

Introduce test IDs with devs; avoid brittle XPath/UI text.

Implement retry on known infra flakes (not on assertion failures).

Parallelize smartly (cap at the # of cores; shard by spec).

Device farm integration (as you scale): BrowserStack/App Center/Bitrise/Firebase Test Lab

Run smoke on local sims; run broader matrix on real devices nightly.

Keep artifacts unified in the same Allure report.

Real-world features

Push notifications, deep links, permissions, background/foreground, geo/sensor mocks, network throttling, locale/timezone matrix.

Add network interception for backend dependency isolation.

Non-functional coverage

Performance smoke (cold start, time-to-first-screen, key flows p95).

Accessibility checks (labels, focus order).

Security basics (no secrets in logs, ATS/network policies).

A quick, concrete next sprint (you could finish this week)

CI: Add GitHub Actions workflow with a matrix for Node + platform; cache ~/.npm and Gradle/CocoaPods; upload Allure, screenshots, and videos as artifacts; comment PR with a link to the report.

Suite hygiene: Add @smoke tag and make it <10 min. Add a flaky category in Allure.

Config: One wdio.shared.conf.ts + wdio.ios.conf.ts / wdio.android.conf.ts.

Docs: A README.md “How to run locally vs CI” + troubleshooting.

If you want a starter outline, here’s a minimal plan you can drop in:

Jobs: lint → build → test:smoke (PR) | test:full (nightly)

Artifacts: allure-results/, videos/, logs/, screenshots/

Env: NODE_ENV=test, platform caps from matrix

Gates: Require test:smoke to merge
